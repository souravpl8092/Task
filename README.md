<h2>Features</h2>

- Timer: The application displays a timer indicating the remaining time for the typing test. By default, the test is set to 5 minutes (300 seconds), but you can change the duration by selecting an option from the dropdown menu.
- Start/Reset: Click the "Start" button to begin the typing test. The timer will start counting down, and a random key will be displayed for you to type. If you want to reset the test, click the "Reset" button.
- Pause/Play: While the test is running, you can pause it by clicking the "Pause" button. To resume the test, click the "Play" button.
- Statistics: The application keeps track of your typing accuracy, correct and incorrect counts, and words per minute (WPM). These statistics are displayed in the score board section.
- Keyboard: The virtual keyboard is displayed on the screen. Type the keys displayed on the keyboard accurately and swiftly to improve your typing skills. The current key you need to type is highlighted.
- Feedback: The keys on the virtual keyboard change color based on your input. Correctly typed keys are highlighted in green, while incorrectly typed keys are highlighted in red.
